- Record length = 100 attributes * 10 bytes = 1000 bytes
- When using fixed_len_sizeof, since strlen bases the length of the data on the null termination character, fixed_len_sizeof returns 1000 bytes though in actuality, the memory of each attribute when read into a Record is 11 bytes including the null terimination character
